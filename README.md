Project Title: Heart Disease Prediction

Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various patient health features. The model can help healthcare providers identify at-risk individuals early and provide timely interventions.

Dataset:
The project uses a dataset from a reliable source (such as Kaggle) containing patient data with features like age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate, and others. The dataset includes both patients with and without heart disease.

Techniques Used:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, encoding categorical data.
Feature Selection: Identifying significant features affecting heart disease prediction.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), gradient boosting and xgboost
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
Tools & Technologies:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook
Expected Outcome:
The project aims to build a robust model that can predict the presence of heart disease with high accuracy, helping in the early detection and prevention of heart-related conditions.
